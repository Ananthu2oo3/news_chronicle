It mixed over 300,000tonnes of asphalt with an average output of 500tonnes/day, and performed reliably despite the tough desert climate. The modular design allows for efficient transportation, and the containerised design provides components with protection against the elements. Filipino contractor Vicente T Lao Construction is now using a customised Linnhoff CMX1500 plant for road construction and rehabilitation work in the Philippines. This is the first Linnhoff CMX plant customised to this configuration in the Philippines."
