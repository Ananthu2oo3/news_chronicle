The project, originally estimated to cost €581 million, has been delayed due to a legal challenge by Transport Action Network accusing the UK government of favoring dual highways over more sustainable public transport, resulting in costs increasing to €750 million. The project will involve upgrading the route from the Black Cat roundabout near St Neots to Caxton Gibbet, creating a 16km dual carriageway to improve journeys between Milton Keynes, Bedford and Cambridge, north of London, as well as improved routes for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. The UK government has allocated €825.3 million for road repairs in south-east England, with the A428 project set to open by 2027."
https://www.worldhighways.com/wh12/products/go-faster-road-inspections-gopro,"BrainCreators has introduced a new functionality for their digital road inspection system, INSPECH, which enables the use of a GoPro camera for data collection. This allows for digital inspections to be done at a reduced cost compared to traditional methods, and allows for flexibility when collecting data. INSPECH is used by local governments, road owners, and operators, and offers two subscription options: IN-Assessment and IN-Insights. INSPECH Assessment automates workflows and INSPECH Insights provides a comprehensive understanding of asset reliability and availability. Data can be collected with professional equipment or a GoPro camera, and customers without professional equipment can work with INSPECH partners. This innovation provides cost-conscious road inspections and maximizes the return on infrastructure investments. INSPECH was founded in Amsterdam by BrainCreators and Unihorn."
