The company has been researching and gathering data to inform changes to the technology, which now self-monitors patterns using the 458MHz band over an extended period, automatically remembering which channels to avoid. This has resulted in no instances of 'lights out' and flawless communications between lights at one of their most challenging sites in central London. The upgraded ACM radio technology takes more account of the bigger picture in terms of other users of the band, making fewer channel changes but the choice of channel is exactly the one required to keep the system running at peak performance."
